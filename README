SDLx::Betweener version 0.01
============================

Will replace SDLx-Tween because it is better.

STATUS

Alpha: only simplest tween and starfield work.

TODO

* start/stop actions on tween with destroyed timelines crash, should
  give error message
* float setters should check and convert value if int by accident
* direct setter value can be upgraded to string and you will never
  see any tween updates, peek and warn if SV nature changes?
* add set_duration
* template specialization on proxies not method overloading
* face angle feature for path tweens
