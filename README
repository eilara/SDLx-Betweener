SDLx::Betweener version 0.01
============================

Will replace SDLx-Tween because it is better.


STATUS

Alpha: only simplest tween and starfield work.


DESIGN

Timeline has a std::set of Tween objects. It broadcasts tick(Uint32 now)
to them.

The Tween tick method normalizes the time given using now/tween_duration,
so that it is between 0 and 1.

Then the time is passed through the easing function, which maps it to some 
eased time value, useful for non-linear speed animations.

The tween then calls tick(Uint32 now) on its ITweenForm. The tween form
translates the eased time into some domain value and pushes it into the
tween target using the tween proxy.

LinearTweenForm interpolates between 2 values ("from" and "to") in a linear
path. The values tweened are Vector<typename T, int DIM>.

PathTweenForm is more general. It lets you tween a Vector<int,2> along a 2D
path, given in construction. LinearPath makes it behave like a LinearTweenForm.
CircularPath tweens along a circle or a pie slice from it. PolylinePath 
tweens along a set of linear segments.

A tween form uses an IProxy for pushing the value into Perl. There are proxies
for setting Perl values (scalar for 1D tween, array ref for 2D) directly,
for calling a callback with the tweened value, and for calling a method.

A uses a CycleControl object for controlling cycle repeat and cycle reverse. 
A tween can be made to run forever, to reverse on cycle completion (bounce),
to start reversed, and to repeat N times.

Tween start/stop registers/unregisters the tween on a timeline.


TODO

* start/stop actions on tween with destroyed timelines crash, should
  give error message
* float setters should check and convert value if int by accident
* direct setter value can be upgraded to string and you will never
  see any tween updates, peek and warn if SV nature changes?
* add set_duration
* template specialization on proxies not method overloading
* face angle feature for path tweens
* SDLx rect proxy
